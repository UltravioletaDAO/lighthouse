### Lighthouse (Faro) - Universal Trustless Monitoring Platform

**Status:** Design Complete, Awaiting Approval
**Priority:** High
**Timeline:** 8 weeks to public launch

| Document | Description | Pages | Status |
|----------|-------------|-------|--------|
| **[lighthouse-master-plan.md](./lighthouse-master-plan.md)** | Comprehensive master plan with full technical specifications | 60+ | ‚úÖ Complete |
| **[lighthouse-vs-watchtower.md](./lighthouse-vs-watchtower.md)** | Comparison with previous WatchTower design, justification for scope expansion | 12 | ‚úÖ Complete |
| **[lighthouse-architecture-diagram.md](./lighthouse-architecture-diagram.md)** | ASCII diagrams showing system flows and multi-cloud deployment | 8 | ‚úÖ Complete |
| **[lighthouse-quick-reference.md](./lighthouse-quick-reference.md)** | Quick summary for presentations and community review | 6 | ‚úÖ Complete |

**Key Points:**
- **Vision:** AWS CloudWatch Synthetics for Web3, 50x cheaper
- **Market:** 1000+ Web3 projects (vs 53 Karmacadabra agents)
- **Revenue Potential:** $200-2000/month (vs $2-3/month for WatchTower)
- **Payment Token:** USDC (universal, stable) instead of GLUE
- **Features:** HTTP + Canary flows + Blockchain balance monitoring + WebSocket + GraphQL
- **Branding:** Bilingual (English "Lighthouse" + Spanish "Faro")
- **Deployment:** Multi-cloud (EigenCloud, AWS, Akash)

**Next Steps:**
1. Review with UltravioletaDAO community
2. Approve $500 Q1 budget
3. Begin MVP development (Week 3)

### WatchTower (Archived) - Karmacadabra-Only Monitoring

**Status:** Superseded by Lighthouse
**Priority:** Archived (not implemented)

| Document | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **[facilitator-monitor.md](./facilitator-monitor.md)** | Original WatchTower design (Karmacadabra agents only) | üóÑÔ∏è Archived |

**Why Superseded:**
- **Limited market:** 53 agents max vs 1000+ projects for Lighthouse
- **GLUE token:** Volatile, low liquidity vs USDC (stable, universal)
- **Basic features:** HTTP only vs 5 monitoring types in Lighthouse
- **Never profitable:** $37/month costs vs $2-3/month revenue

**Lighthouse supersedes WatchTower** with 100x larger market and 10x more features.

### Simulation Scenarios

**Status:** Research / Planning

| Document | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **[simulation-scenarios.md](./simulation-scenarios.md)** | Test scenarios for ecosystem validation | üìù Draft |
