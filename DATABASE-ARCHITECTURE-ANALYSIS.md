# Lighthouse Database Architecture: Deep Analysis

**Author:** Master Architect (Claude Code)
**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Status:** Architectural Decision Document
**Impact:** Critical - Foundation for entire platform

---

## Executive Summary

**RECOMMENDATION: Hybrid PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB**

After analyzing 5 database options against Lighthouse's specific workload patterns, I recommend **PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension** as the primary database, with the following rationale:

1. **90% of data is time-series** (uptime checks), requiring specialized storage
2. **10% is relational** (subscriptions, users, configuration), requiring ACID guarantees
3. **AWS deployment** favors managed services (RDS) over self-hosted databases
4. **Cost optimization** is critical at scale (1000+ customers)
5. **Wrong choice is expensive to migrate** - millions of data points, 24/7 uptime requirement

The current master plan's MongoDB choice was **not architecturally justified** and represents a **default to familiarity** rather than **fitness for purpose**.

---

## Critical Context: Lighthouse Data Model

### Data Breakdown (by volume)

| Data Type | % of Total | Write Frequency | Query Pattern | Retention |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Check results** | ~85% | 1000+ writes/min | Range queries, aggregations | 90 days |
| **Metrics aggregates** | ~10% | Daily rollups | Dashboard queries | 1 year |
| **Subscriptions** | ~3% | Occasional | CRUD, joins | Indefinite |
| **Alerts** | ~2% | Burst writes | Recent history | 90 days |

**Key insight:** This is a **time-series dominant workload** with **relational metadata**.

### Query Patterns

**95% of queries are time-series:**
- "Show uptime for subscription X over last 7 days"
- "Calculate average response time by hour for last month"
- "Aggregate success rate by endpoint across all users"
- "Show recent check history with pagination"

**5% are relational:**
- "Get subscription config with user details and alert channels"
- "Update subscription tier and pricing"
- "List all active subscriptions for user wallet address"

### Scale Projections

| Metric | MVP (Month 1) | Growth (Year 1) | Scale (Year 2) |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Active subscriptions** | 50 | 500 | 5,000 |
| **Checks per day** | 14,400 (50 × 5-min) | 144,000 | 1,440,000 |
| **Data points per day** | 14,400 | 144,000 | 1,440,000 |
| **Total data (90-day retain)** | 1.3M records | 13M records | 130M records |
| **Storage estimate** | ~500 MB | ~5 GB | ~50 GB |

---

## Option 1: MongoDB (Current Master Plan)

### Technical Fit

**Time-Series Collections (MongoDB 5.0+):**
```javascript
db.createCollection("check_history", {
  timeseries: {
    timeField: "timestamp",
    metaField: "subscription_id",
    granularity: "minutes"
  },
  expireAfterSeconds: 7776000  // 90 days
})
```

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Native time-series support since v5.0 (automatic bucketing, compression)
- ✅ Flexible schema for varying monitor configs (HTTP vs WebSocket vs Balance)
- ✅ Document model fits subscription configs well (nested alert channels)
- ✅ Familiar to team (karma-hello uses MongoDB)
- ✅ Aggregation pipeline is powerful for complex queries
- ✅ TTL indexes for automatic data expiration

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ **Time-series collections have limitations:**
  - Cannot update individual measurements (write-only after insert)
  - Cannot delete individual measurements (only via TTL)
  - Limited secondary indexes (only on metaField)
  - No transactions across time-series and regular collections
- ❌ **MongoDB Atlas pricing is expensive at scale:**
  - M10 (2GB RAM, 10GB storage): $57/month
  - M20 (4GB RAM, 20GB storage): $140/month
  - M30 (8GB RAM, 40GB storage): $300/month
  - **Cost grows 2-3x faster than PostgreSQL RDS**
- ❌ **Rust ecosystem support is weaker:**
  - `mongodb` crate is async-only (good) but less mature than `tokio-postgres`
  - Less tooling for migrations (no equivalent to `sqlx` compile-time checks)
- ❌ **Self-hosting complexity:**
  - Requires replica set for production (3 nodes minimum)
  - Manual sharding setup for horizontal scaling
  - Ops overhead higher than PostgreSQL
- ❌ **Lock-in risk:**
  - MongoDB Atlas has unique features (Charts, Realm) that create vendor lock-in
  - Migrating to self-hosted MongoDB requires infrastructure changes

### Cost Analysis (3-Year TCO)

| Deployment | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Total |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Atlas M10** (50 subs) | $684 | $684 | $684 | **$2,052** |
| **Atlas M20** (500 subs) | - | $1,680 | $1,680 | **$3,360** |
| **Atlas M30** (5000 subs) | - | - | $3,600 | **$3,600** |
| **Total** | $684 | $2,364 | $5,964 | **$9,012** |

**Self-hosted alternative:** ~$30/month (Digital Ocean droplet) = $1,080 over 3 years, but requires ops expertise.

### Architecture Alignment

**Karmacadabra Precedent:**
- karma-hello uses MongoDB for chat logs (append-only, high write volume)
- Pattern: MongoDB for agents' data storage

**BUT:** Lighthouse is **not a Karmacadabra agent**. It's a standalone platform with different requirements:
- Agents store **raw data** (logs, transcripts) → MongoDB fits
- Lighthouse stores **operational metrics** (time-series + config) → Hybrid DB fits better

**Verdict:** MongoDB works, but is **not optimized** for this workload.

---

## Option 2: DynamoDB (AWS Native)

### Technical Fit

**Time-Series with DynamoDB:**
```
PK (Partition Key): subscription_id
SK (Sort Key): timestamp

GSI1: target_url + timestamp (query across subscriptions)
```

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **AWS native** - Zero operations, automatic scaling
- ✅ **Pay-per-request pricing** - Cost matches usage perfectly
- ✅ **Single-digit millisecond latency** at any scale
- ✅ **Built-in TTL** for automatic data expiration
- ✅ **Point-in-time recovery** and backups included
- ✅ **Rust support excellent** - `aws-sdk-dynamodb` is first-class

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ **Complete AWS lock-in:**
  - Cannot self-host DynamoDB (LocalStack is dev-only)
  - Cannot migrate to GCP, Azure, EigenCloud, or Akash Network
  - **VIOLATES Lighthouse principle: "Easy self-hosting"**
- ❌ **Poor time-series query support:**
  - No native aggregations (SUM, AVG, percentiles)
  - Must read all items and aggregate in application code
  - "Calculate average latency for last 7 days" requires scanning thousands of items
  - **Expensive for analytics queries** (dashboard loads)
- ❌ **Limited querying:**
  - Can only query by PK + SK range
  - GSIs limited to 20 per table
  - No full-text search, no complex filtering
  - No JOINs (must denormalize or multiple queries)
- ❌ **Hidden costs at scale:**
  - On-demand mode: $1.25 per million writes, $0.25 per million reads
  - 1.4M checks/day = ~$1,750/month writes + $350/month reads = **$2,100/month**
  - **70x more expensive than PostgreSQL RDS at scale**
- ❌ **Schema rigidity:**
  - Changing access patterns requires GSI creation (expensive)
  - Cannot add indexes retroactively without migration
  - NoSQL modeling is complex for relational data (subscriptions + users + alerts)

### Cost Analysis (3-Year TCO)

| Load | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Total |
|------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| **MVP** (14k checks/day) | $360 | $360 | $360 | **$1,080** |
| **Growth** (144k checks/day) | - | $3,600 | $3,600 | **$7,200** |
| **Scale** (1.44M checks/day) | - | - | $25,200 | **$25,200** |
| **Total** | $360 | $3,960 | $29,160 | **$33,480** |

**Note:** On-demand pricing. Provisioned capacity is cheaper but requires capacity planning.

### Architecture Alignment

**AWS Commitment:**
- Lighthouse master plan mentions **EigenCloud as primary deployment**
- "Fallback: AWS ECS Fargate"
- DynamoDB forces permanent AWS dependency

**Trustless Principle:**
- Lighthouse positions as "open-source, self-hostable alternative to AWS Synthetics"
- DynamoDB contradicts this (cannot self-host)

**Verdict:** DynamoDB is **architecturally incompatible** with Lighthouse's multi-cloud strategy.

---

## Option 3: PostgreSQL (Relational Database)

### Technical Fit

**Schema Design:**
```sql
-- Relational tables
CREATE TABLE subscriptions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_wallet VARCHAR(42) NOT NULL,
  target_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  target_config JSONB NOT NULL,  -- Flexible config per monitor type
  tier VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  INDEX idx_user_wallet (user_wallet)
);

CREATE TABLE alert_channels (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  subscription_id UUID REFERENCES subscriptions(id),
  channel_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,  -- discord, telegram, email
  config JSONB NOT NULL,
  INDEX idx_subscription (subscription_id)
);

-- Time-series table
CREATE TABLE check_history (
  subscription_id UUID NOT NULL,
  timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  http_status INTEGER,
  latency_ms INTEGER,
  error TEXT,
  alert_triggered BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  PRIMARY KEY (subscription_id, timestamp)
);

-- Partition by time for performance
CREATE TABLE check_history_2025_10 PARTITION OF check_history
  FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-10-01') TO ('2025-11-01');
```

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **ACID guarantees** - Critical for subscription payments and state management
- ✅ **Mature ecosystem:**
  - `tokio-postgres` and `sqlx` are production-ready Rust crates
  - `sqlx` has compile-time query verification (catch errors at build time)
  - Rich migration tooling (`sqlx migrate`, `refinery`)
- ✅ **AWS RDS is battle-tested:**
  - Automatic backups, point-in-time recovery
  - Multi-AZ for high availability
  - Read replicas for scaling reads
  - $30-60/month for production workload (db.t4g.small/medium)
- ✅ **Self-hosting is straightforward:**
  - Docker image: `postgres:16-alpine`
  - Managed options: Supabase, Neon, Crunchy Bridge
  - Works on any cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure, Hetzner, bare metal)
- ✅ **Best-in-class tooling:**
  - pgAdmin, DBeaver, Datagrip for GUI management
  - `pg_dump` for backups, `pg_restore` for recovery
  - Extensive monitoring ecosystem (pg_stat_statements, pgBadger)
- ✅ **Flexible querying:**
  - JOINs for complex relational queries
  - Window functions for time-series analytics
  - Full-text search with `tsvector`
  - JSONB for flexible config storage

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ **Time-series performance concerns:**
  - Native PostgreSQL is not optimized for time-series writes
  - At 1.4M checks/day, index maintenance overhead grows
  - Partitioning helps but requires manual maintenance
  - Aggregation queries (AVG, percentiles) are slower than specialized time-series DBs
- ❌ **Storage overhead:**
  - Row-based storage is less efficient than columnar (influxDB) or bucketed (MongoDB)
  - 130M time-series records = ~80-100 GB (vs 50 GB with compression)
- ❌ **Scaling writes:**
  - Single-master architecture limits write throughput
  - Sharding PostgreSQL is complex (Citus extension or manual)
  - At 1000+ checks/sec, need careful tuning or read replicas

### Cost Analysis (3-Year TCO)

| Instance Type | vCPU | RAM | Storage | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Total |
|---------------|------|-----|---------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| **db.t4g.micro** | 2 | 1GB | 20GB | $180 | $180 | - | **$360** |
| **db.t4g.small** | 2 | 2GB | 50GB | $360 | $360 | $360 | **$1,080** |
| **db.t4g.medium** | 2 | 4GB | 100GB | - | $720 | $720 | **$1,440** |
| **Total** | - | - | - | $540 | $1,260 | $1,080 | **$2,880** |

**Self-hosted:** $12-20/month (2GB RAM droplet) = $432-720 over 3 years.

### Architecture Alignment

**Karmacadabra Precedent:**
- No existing PostgreSQL usage in agents
- BUT: Lighthouse is standalone (different stack is acceptable)

**Rust Ecosystem:**
- `sqlx` is more mature than `mongodb` crate
- Compile-time query checking prevents runtime errors

**Multi-Cloud:**
- PostgreSQL works everywhere (full portability)

**Verdict:** PostgreSQL is **solid choice** but needs time-series optimization.

---

## Option 4: TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL Extension)

### Technical Fit

**What is TimescaleDB?**
- PostgreSQL extension (not a separate database)
- Adds **hypertables** (automatic partitioning for time-series data)
- Adds **continuous aggregates** (materialized views that auto-update)
- 100% SQL compatible (use standard PostgreSQL tools)

**Schema Design:**
```sql
-- Regular PostgreSQL table
CREATE TABLE subscriptions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_wallet VARCHAR(42) NOT NULL,
  target_config JSONB NOT NULL,
  tier VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- TimescaleDB hypertable (looks like normal table)
CREATE TABLE check_history (
  time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  subscription_id UUID NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  latency_ms INTEGER,
  http_status INTEGER
);

-- Convert to hypertable (automatic time-based partitioning)
SELECT create_hypertable('check_history', 'time', chunk_time_interval => INTERVAL '1 day');

-- Compression policy (10x storage savings after 7 days)
ALTER TABLE check_history SET (
  timescaledb.compress,
  timescaledb.compress_segmentby = 'subscription_id'
);

SELECT add_compression_policy('check_history', INTERVAL '7 days');

-- Retention policy (auto-delete after 90 days)
SELECT add_retention_policy('check_history', INTERVAL '90 days');

-- Continuous aggregates (hourly metrics, auto-updated)
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW hourly_metrics
WITH (timescaledb.continuous) AS
SELECT
  time_bucket('1 hour', time) AS hour,
  subscription_id,
  AVG(latency_ms) AS avg_latency,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY latency_ms) AS p95_latency,
  COUNT(*) AS total_checks,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'success' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS successful_checks
FROM check_history
GROUP BY hour, subscription_id;

-- Refresh policy (update every hour)
SELECT add_continuous_aggregate_policy('hourly_metrics',
  start_offset => INTERVAL '2 hours',
  end_offset => INTERVAL '1 hour',
  schedule_interval => INTERVAL '1 hour');
```

**Query Performance Examples:**

```sql
-- Standard query (uses hypertable partitioning automatically)
SELECT time, latency_ms
FROM check_history
WHERE subscription_id = '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'
  AND time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY time DESC;

-- Dashboard query (uses continuous aggregate, instant results)
SELECT hour, avg_latency, p95_latency
FROM hourly_metrics
WHERE subscription_id = '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'
  AND hour >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
ORDER BY hour DESC;

-- Multi-subscription aggregate (optimized by TimescaleDB)
SELECT subscription_id, AVG(latency_ms) AS avg_latency
FROM check_history
WHERE time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY subscription_id;
```

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Best of both worlds:**
  - PostgreSQL's ACID guarantees and ecosystem
  - Time-series database performance and features
- ✅ **Automatic optimizations:**
  - Partitioning is automatic (no manual partition management)
  - Compression reduces storage by 10x (similar to MongoDB time-series)
  - Auto-retention policies (no manual cleanup jobs)
- ✅ **Continuous aggregates = instant dashboards:**
  - Pre-compute hourly/daily metrics in background
  - Dashboard queries become instant (query aggregates, not raw data)
  - Auto-updating (no manual rollup jobs)
- ✅ **Same tooling as PostgreSQL:**
  - `tokio-postgres`, `sqlx`, `pgAdmin` all work
  - Backup/restore with `pg_dump`
  - Same operational playbook
- ✅ **AWS RDS support:**
  - TimescaleDB available on RDS (install extension via SQL)
  - No separate service needed
- ✅ **Self-hosting options:**
  - Docker: `timescale/timescaledb:latest-pg16`
  - Managed: Timescale Cloud, Supabase, Aiven
  - Works on any cloud
- ✅ **Cost efficiency:**
  - Compression reduces storage costs 10x
  - Continuous aggregates reduce query costs (fewer full scans)
  - Same pricing as PostgreSQL (extension is free)
- ✅ **Migration path:**
  - Start with PostgreSQL, add TimescaleDB extension later
  - Zero downtime migration (add extension, convert tables)

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ **Learning curve:**
  - Team needs to learn TimescaleDB-specific features (hypertables, continuous aggregates)
  - NOT standard SQL (extension functions)
- ❌ **Extension management:**
  - Must install extension on every PostgreSQL instance
  - Version compatibility (TimescaleDB X.Y requires PostgreSQL Z)
  - RDS extension updates lag behind community releases
- ❌ **Less mature than vanilla PostgreSQL:**
  - TimescaleDB is ~8 years old (PostgreSQL is ~30 years old)
  - Smaller community, fewer tutorials
  - Some edge cases and bugs (e.g., complex window functions over compressed chunks)
- ❌ **Vendor risk:**
  - TimescaleDB company could change licensing (like MongoDB → SSPL, or Elastic → SSPL)
  - Currently Apache 2.0 (safe) but no guarantees

### Cost Analysis (3-Year TCO)

**Identical to PostgreSQL** (extension is free):

| Instance Type | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Total |
|---------------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| **db.t4g.small** | $360 | $360 | $360 | **$1,080** |
| **db.t4g.medium** | - | $720 | $720 | **$1,440** |
| **Total** | $360 | $1,080 | $1,080 | **$2,520** |

**Storage savings:** 10x compression → ~$50-100 saved on storage costs over 3 years.

### Architecture Alignment

**Perfect fit for Lighthouse:**
1. **Time-series dominant** (90% of data) → Hypertables + compression
2. **Relational metadata** (10% of data) → Standard PostgreSQL tables
3. **Dashboard queries** → Continuous aggregates (instant results)
4. **Auto-retention** → Built-in policies (no manual cleanup)
5. **Multi-cloud** → Works everywhere PostgreSQL works
6. **Self-hosting** → Docker image available
7. **Rust ecosystem** → Same as PostgreSQL (`sqlx`)

**Verdict:** TimescaleDB is **purpose-built for this exact workload**.

---

## Option 5: InfluxDB (Purpose-Built Time-Series)

### Technical Fit

**Schema Design:**
```
# InfluxDB Line Protocol
check_history,subscription_id=123,target=https://example.com status="success",latency_ms=145,http_status=200 1635724800000000000

# Query (Flux language)
from(bucket: "lighthouse")
  |> range(start: -7d)
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r["subscription_id"] == "123")
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_measurement"] == "check_history")
  |> mean(column: "latency_ms")
```

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Best time-series performance:**
  - Columnar storage optimized for writes (100k+ points/sec)
  - Built-in downsampling and retention policies
  - Optimized for aggregation queries (AVG, percentiles, histograms)
- ✅ **Efficient storage:**
  - Compression ratios of 20:1 (better than MongoDB/TimescaleDB)
  - Automatic data compaction
- ✅ **Built-in features:**
  - Alerting engine (Kapacitor)
  - Visualization (Chronograf)
  - Telegraf for metrics collection

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ **Two-database architecture:**
  - InfluxDB for time-series → PostgreSQL for subscriptions/users
  - Complexity: Two connections, two schemas, two backups
  - Cannot JOIN across databases (must do in application)
- ❌ **Flux query language:**
  - NOT SQL (steeper learning curve)
  - Rust support is weak (`influxdb` crate is unmaintained)
  - No compile-time query checking
- ❌ **InfluxDB Cloud pricing is expensive:**
  - $0.25 per GB ingested + $0.10 per GB stored per month
  - 1.4M checks/day × 200 bytes = 280 MB/day = ~$25/month ingestion
  - **More expensive than TimescaleDB**
- ❌ **Self-hosting complexity:**
  - InfluxDB 2.x requires more resources (2GB+ RAM)
  - Less mature than PostgreSQL for ops (backups, monitoring)
- ❌ **No ACID guarantees:**
  - Cannot store subscriptions in InfluxDB (no relational model)
  - Risk of data inconsistency between InfluxDB + PostgreSQL

### Cost Analysis (3-Year TCO)

| Component | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Total |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| **InfluxDB Cloud** | $360 | $3,600 | $9,000 | **$12,960** |
| **PostgreSQL RDS** (metadata) | $360 | $360 | $360 | **$1,080** |
| **Total** | $720 | $3,960 | $9,360 | **$14,040** |

**Self-hosted:** ~$40/month (InfluxDB + PostgreSQL) = $1,440 over 3 years.

### Architecture Alignment

**Complexity vs Benefit:**
- Two databases add operational complexity
- Application code manages consistency between DBs
- Backup/restore requires coordinating both systems

**Rust Ecosystem:**
- InfluxDB Rust client is weak (unmaintained)
- Flux language has no Rust type safety

**Verdict:** InfluxDB is **overkill** for Lighthouse's scale (better suited for 10M+ points/day).

## Final Recommendation: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB

### Why TimescaleDB Wins

1. **Purpose-Built for This Exact Workload**
   - Hybrid time-series + relational data → Hypertables + standard tables
   - 90% time-series efficiency + 10% relational integrity = perfect balance

2. **Cost Efficiency**
   - **$2,520 over 3 years** (cheapest managed option)
   - 10x compression reduces storage costs
   - Continuous aggregates reduce query costs

3. **Multi-Cloud Portability**
   - Works on AWS RDS, GCP Cloud SQL, Azure Database, Supabase, self-hosted
   - Zero vendor lock-in (unlike DynamoDB)
   - Supports Lighthouse's "EigenCloud OR AWS" strategy

4. **Developer Experience**
   - Standard SQL + TimescaleDB functions (easy to learn)
   - `sqlx` compile-time query checking (catch bugs early)
   - Rich tooling (pgAdmin, DBeaver, Datagrip)

5. **Operational Simplicity**
   - Single database (not two like InfluxDB + PostgreSQL)
   - Automatic partitioning, compression, retention (no manual jobs)
   - Battle-tested PostgreSQL reliability

6. **Dashboard Performance**
   - Continuous aggregates make dashboard queries instant
   - "Show uptime for last 30 days" → Query pre-computed hourly metrics (not 43,200 raw checks)

7. **Migration Safety**
   - Can start with vanilla PostgreSQL, add TimescaleDB later
   - Rollback path exists (convert hypertables back to regular tables)

### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: PostgreSQL Foundation (Week 1-2)**
```sql
-- Standard PostgreSQL tables
CREATE TABLE subscriptions (...);
CREATE TABLE alert_channels (...);
CREATE TABLE check_history (
  time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  subscription_id UUID NOT NULL,
  ...
);
```

**Phase 2: Add TimescaleDB (Week 3)**
```sql
-- Install extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS timescaledb;

-- Convert to hypertable (zero downtime)
SELECT create_hypertable('check_history', 'time', migrate_data => TRUE);

-- Add compression policy
ALTER TABLE check_history SET (timescaledb.compress);
SELECT add_compression_policy('check_history', INTERVAL '7 days');

-- Add retention policy
SELECT add_retention_policy('check_history', INTERVAL '90 days');
```

**Phase 3: Continuous Aggregates (Week 4)**
```sql
-- Hourly metrics for dashboards
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW hourly_metrics
WITH (timescaledb.continuous) AS
SELECT
  time_bucket('1 hour', time) AS hour,
  subscription_id,
  AVG(latency_ms) AS avg_latency,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY latency_ms) AS p95_latency,
  COUNT(*) AS total_checks,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'success' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::FLOAT / COUNT(*) AS uptime
FROM check_history
GROUP BY hour, subscription_id;

-- Daily metrics for historical reports
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW daily_metrics
WITH (timescaledb.continuous) AS
SELECT
  time_bucket('1 day', time) AS day,
  subscription_id,
  AVG(latency_ms) AS avg_latency,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY latency_ms) AS p95_latency,
  COUNT(*) AS total_checks,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'success' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::FLOAT / COUNT(*) AS uptime
FROM check_history
GROUP BY day, subscription_id;
```

**Rust Code Integration:**
```rust
// Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
sqlx = { version = "0.7", features = ["postgres", "runtime-tokio-rustls", "uuid", "chrono", "json"] }
tokio-postgres = "0.7"

// Database connection
use sqlx::{PgPool, postgres::PgPoolOptions};

#[derive(Debug, sqlx::FromRow)]
struct CheckHistory {
    time: chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>,

### Deployment Configuration

**AWS RDS (Managed):**
```bash
# Create RDS PostgreSQL instance
aws rds create-db-instance \
  --db-instance-identifier lighthouse-prod \
  --db-instance-class db.t4g.small \
  --engine postgres \
  --engine-version 16.1 \
  --master-username postgres \
  --master-user-password "${DB_PASSWORD}" \
  --allocated-storage 50 \
  --storage-type gp3 \
  --backup-retention-period 7 \
  --multi-az \
  --region us-east-1

# Connect and install extension
psql -h lighthouse-prod.abc123.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -U postgres -c "CREATE EXTENSION timescaledb;"
```

**Self-Hosted (Docker):**
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  postgres:
    image: timescale/timescaledb:latest-pg16
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: lighthouse
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD}
    volumes:
      - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
      - ./init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  postgres-data:
```

**EigenCloud Deployment:**
- Deploy TimescaleDB Docker container
- Use managed PostgreSQL provider (Neon, Supabase) with TimescaleDB extension

### Migration Path If Wrong

**If TimescaleDB proves inadequate:**

1. **Scale-up PostgreSQL** (months 6-12):
   - Upgrade to db.r6g.large (8GB RAM) = $300/month
   - Add read replicas for dashboard queries
   - Aggressive partitioning and index optimization

2. **Migrate to InfluxDB** (year 2+):
   - Export time-series data to InfluxDB
   - Keep PostgreSQL for subscriptions/users
   - Hybrid architecture (acceptable at 10M+ points/day)

3. **Migrate to ClickHouse** (year 3+):
   - Columnar database for massive scale (100M+ points/day)
   - PostgreSQL for metadata
   - Requires significant engineering effort

**Cost of Wrong Choice:**
- MongoDB → TimescaleDB: ~$5,000 migration cost (re-architect, test, migrate 13M records)
- DynamoDB → TimescaleDB: ~$10,000 migration cost (complete rewrite, different data model)
- TimescaleDB → InfluxDB: ~$3,000 migration cost (time-series only, keep PostgreSQL)

**TimescaleDB has the safest migration paths** (it's PostgreSQL underneath).

## Addressing MongoDB's Master Plan Choice

### Why MongoDB Was Chosen (Likely Reasoning)

1. **Familiarity** - karma-hello uses MongoDB
2. **Time-series collections** - MongoDB 5.0+ has native support
3. **Schema flexibility** - Varying monitor configs (HTTP, WebSocket, Balance)
4. **Aggregation pipeline** - Powerful for complex queries

### Why This Was Insufficient Analysis

1. **No cost comparison** - MongoDB Atlas is 3x more expensive than TimescaleDB
2. **No multi-cloud evaluation** - Missed DynamoDB's lock-in and TimescaleDB's portability
3. **No scale analysis** - 130M records → TimescaleDB compression saves $1,000s
4. **No query pattern analysis** - Missed continuous aggregates (instant dashboards)
5. **No migration risk assessment** - MongoDB time-series cannot be rolled back easily

### MongoDB Is Not Wrong, Just Suboptimal

MongoDB **will work** for Lighthouse. But:
- Costs 3-4x more at scale ($9,012 vs $2,520)
- Slower dashboard queries (no continuous aggregates)
- Harder self-hosting (replica sets, sharding)
- Vendor lock-in risk (Atlas pricing, Realm dependencies)

**It's the "safe but expensive" choice, not the "optimal" choice.**

## Questions to Resolve Before Finalizing

### 1. EigenCloud Constraints

**Question:** Does EigenCloud support managed PostgreSQL, or only Docker containers?

**Impact:**
- If managed PostgreSQL → TimescaleDB via RDS-equivalent
- If Docker only → Self-hosted TimescaleDB (requires ops expertise)
- If neither → MongoDB Atlas (separate service)

**Action:** Research EigenCloud documentation before Week 1.

### 2. Continuous Aggregates vs Real-Time

**Question:** Are 1-hour delayed aggregates acceptable for dashboards?

**Current design:**
- Continuous aggregates refresh every hour
- Dashboard shows metrics with 1-hour lag

**Alternative:**
- Real-time queries (slower, no caching)
- 5-minute refresh interval (more compute)

**Recommendation:** 1-hour lag is acceptable (industry standard). Add real-time toggle for Enterprise tier.

### 3. Multi-Region Strategy

**Question:** Will Lighthouse deploy multi-region in Year 1?

**Impact:**
- Single region → Standard PostgreSQL RDS (db.t4g.small)
- Multi-region → PostgreSQL Aurora Global Database ($500+/month)
- Multi-region → MongoDB Atlas Global Clusters ($140+/month)

**Recommendation:** Start single-region (us-east-1), add multi-region in Year 2+ if needed.

### 4. Blockchain Data in Phase 3

**Question:** Smart contract monitoring adds on-chain data. Does this change DB choice?

**Analysis:**
- Balance checks (current plan) → Same schema (time-series)
- Contract state monitoring → New table (time-series)
- Transaction history → New table (time-series)

**Verdict:** TimescaleDB handles this well (add more hypertables). No architecture change needed.

## Implementation Checklist

**Week 1: Database Setup**
- [ ] Provision PostgreSQL RDS (db.t4g.small, 50GB, Multi-AZ)
- [ ] Install TimescaleDB extension (`CREATE EXTENSION timescaledb`)
- [ ] Create standard tables (subscriptions, users, alert_channels)
- [ ] Create time-series table (check_history)
- [ ] Convert to hypertable (`create_hypertable`)
- [ ] Test write performance (simulate 1000 checks/min)

**Week 2: Schema & Migrations**
- [ ] Add `sqlx` to Cargo.toml with compile-time checks
- [ ] Create migration files (`sqlx migrate add init`)
- [ ] Implement database layer in Rust (`database/mod.rs`)
- [ ] Add connection pooling (`PgPoolOptions::new().max_connections(20)`)
- [ ] Test queries with `sqlx::query!()` macro

**Week 3: Time-Series Optimizations**
- [ ] Add compression policy (7-day delay)
- [ ] Add retention policy (90-day TTL)
- [ ] Test compression ratio (expect ~10x savings)
- [ ] Monitor disk usage (should plateau after 90 days)

**Week 4: Continuous Aggregates**
- [ ] Create hourly_metrics view
- [ ] Create daily_metrics view
- [ ] Add refresh policies (1-hour interval)
- [ ] Update dashboard API to query aggregates (not raw data)
- [ ] Benchmark query performance (expect <100ms for 30-day ranges)

**Week 5: Backups & Monitoring**
- [ ] Configure automated RDS backups (7-day retention)
- [ ] Set up CloudWatch alarms (CPU, connections, disk usage)
- [ ] Add `pg_stat_statements` for query monitoring
- [ ] Test point-in-time recovery (restore to 5 minutes ago)

**Week 6: Load Testing**
- [ ] Simulate 500 concurrent subscriptions
- [ ] Simulate 1000 checks/minute write load
- [ ] Measure query latency (dashboard queries)
- [ ] Identify slow queries with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`
- [ ] Add indexes if needed (subscription_id, time ranges)

## Conclusion

**RECOMMENDATION: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB**

**Reasoning:**
1. **Best fit for workload** - Hybrid time-series + relational is exactly what TimescaleDB solves
2. **Lowest 3-year TCO** - $2,520 (vs $9,012 MongoDB, $33,480 DynamoDB)
3. **Multi-cloud portability** - No vendor lock-in, works everywhere
4. **Developer experience** - Best Rust support, compile-time query checks
5. **Dashboard performance** - Continuous aggregates make queries instant
6. **Operational maturity** - PostgreSQL reliability + TimescaleDB features
7. **Migration safety** - Can roll back to vanilla PostgreSQL if needed

**MongoDB is not wrong, but TimescaleDB is more correct.**

The master plan's MongoDB choice was **insufficiently justified**. It defaulted to familiarity without:
- Cost analysis (missed 3-4x price difference)
- Scale projections (missed compression savings)
- Query pattern optimization (missed continuous aggregates)
- Multi-cloud evaluation (missed lock-in risks)

**This is exactly the kind of architectural oversight the Master Architect exists to catch.**

**Next Steps:**

1. **Validate with team** - Review this analysis, challenge assumptions
2. **Prototype TimescaleDB** - Build Week 1 schema, test write performance
3. **Update master plan** - Replace MongoDB sections with TimescaleDB
4. **Update README** - Reflect new database choice
5. **Proceed with implementation** - Week 1 tasks (RDS setup, schema creation)

**Files to Update:**
- `lighthouse/lighthouse-master-plan.md` (Section 3: Technology Stack)
- `lighthouse/lighthouse-architecture-diagram.md` (Database layer)
- `lighthouse/README.md` (Tech stack section)
- `lighthouse/backend/Cargo.toml` (Replace `mongodb` with `sqlx`)
- `lighthouse/.env.example` (Replace MONGODB_URI with DATABASE_URL)
